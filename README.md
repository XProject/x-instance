Instance System for FiveM's OneSync Infinity

I know it's easier to achieve this using routing buckets, but for more enhanced & realistic player experience(seeing other players while looking through ipl properties windows), I decides to write an instance system like old ESX instance, while ensuring performance optimization and compatibility with OneSync Infinity

## TODO
- [ ] Find a way to prevent instanced players from hearing each other(possibly through pma-voice export).
- [ ] Find a way to disable pvp between instanced players that are not in a same instance.
- [ ] Find a way to disable gun shots to be heard by instanced players.
- [ ] Optimize it more than its current state.
